    <p>This is Mugoh! I'm an undergrad, working on bringing more beneficial Reinforcement Learning applications to the real world. I'm using this blog to document my learning. Occassionally, I leave some shorter thoughts <a href="https://medium.com/@mugoh">on medium</a> too. If you have a question or happen to find errors, get in touch with me through: mugoh [dot] ks [AT] gmail.com. Thanks :)</p>
